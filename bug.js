This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with an error related to missing or incorrect dependencies, specifically those related to React Native components or native modules. The error messages aren't always clear and point to seemingly unrelated issues. The project compiles successfully on iOS, but fails only on Android. This is often compounded by the difficulty in tracing the root cause through the verbose Expo build logs.
