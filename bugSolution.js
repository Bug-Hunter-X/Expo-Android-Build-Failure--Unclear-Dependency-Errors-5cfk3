The solution typically involves carefully examining the error logs, cleaning the project, and ensuring dependency versions and native modules are correctly configured.  For instance, double-check `package.json` for conflicting versions or missing packages. Clearing the cache (using commands such as `expo prebuild --clean` and/or `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`) can often resolve inconsistencies. In more complex cases, verifying the project's Android setup (e.g., Android SDK, Gradle) might be necessary.  Finally, if the issues persist, isolating and debugging the native modules by testing with and without individual components can lead to identification and resolution of the root cause.  It's important to update all Expo related packages to their latest versions to get compatibility fixes.
